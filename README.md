This is my implementation of a classic FPS in Lua, using Love2D framework. 
Still have to iron out some kinks with textures, but will soon course correct. 

- Traditional column based strip rendering for raycasting. 
- DDA for angle calculation accuracy.
- Data oriented approach with the only overhead being the love2D framework, if any at all.
